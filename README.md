# Using the software
### Quick start
In order to just see how it works. A quick example has been made in meshNework.py
```
python3 meshNetwork.py
```
This will spawn three Nodes. 1,2,3. Perform Network discovery and thereafter Node 1 messages Node 3 with a "Hello world". Routing its message through 2.
